The main objective of this project is to build a rudimentary and autonomous robot,like plotting table, which will be able to:

1. analyze the grid of sudoku to be filled
2. solve the Sudoku problem
3. fill the grid

That means the robot must be able to process the grid to be solved in order to detect the boxes already filled,their values and then proceed to filling.

At the end, the result should be something like that:
